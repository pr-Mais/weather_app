# Simple Weather App

A Flutter sample, that uses Open Weather API to show current weather based on the user's location.

## Getting Started

Of course I'm supposing you already have Flutter installed correctly on your machine :)
If not, please to the [installation guide](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)!
<br>
To run this sample, you need to clone it first, then signup to [OpenWeather](https://home.openweathermap.org/) to get your API key, the sample won't show any data without it. 
<br> NOTE: *After signup, you will find your key in this [link](https://home.openweathermap.org/api_keys), add it to this [file](https://github.com/pr-Mais/weather_app/blob/master/lib/key.dart)*
